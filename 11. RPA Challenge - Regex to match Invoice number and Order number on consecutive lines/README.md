# 11. RPA Challenge - Regex to match Invoice number and Order number on consecutive lines

This robot solves the RPA Challenge page (`http://rpachallenge.com/`) as described in `https://forum.uipath.com/t/11-rpa-challenge-regex-to-match-invoice-number-and-order-number-on-consecutive-lines/9374`. To run it you can download rcc (`https://github.com/robocorp/rcc`), go to the bot directory and execute de command `rcc run`.

**Note:** I was not sure at all about de `XAML` file, so I will just write it to a `.txt` file and if I understand this part later, I will fix it.
