# Uipath Challenges with Robocorp

This repo contains bots that use Robocorp libraries to solve the challenges from Uipath (`https://forum.uipath.com/c/random/automation-challenge/22`). I will add them as I finish them

To run them you need `RCC` (`https://github.com/robocorp/rcc`) and, in most cases, to run them you have to open rcc or go in the terminal to the robot directory and write: `rcc run`. The first time you run that command it will take a while because it creates the environment the bot will use. You can check later the log in the output folder in the bot directory. The Log that will appear in the console will not be basic

**Note:** The challenges 2 and 3 are not that practical, they are more to think that to code, so I did not uploaded them. Challenge 8 is not completed yet, OCR is falling, it somehow recognize the 1 and 2 with other things. I can't find a way to do Challenge 10 with right now. I don't have a Citrix account to use in Challenge 11, but the other Challenge 11 is OK. In Challenge 12 I need to find first some images to use and later search for.
