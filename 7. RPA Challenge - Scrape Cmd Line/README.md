# 7. RPA Challenge - Scrape Cmd Line

This robot solves the RPA Challenge page (`http://rpachallenge.com/`) as described in `https://forum.uipath.com/t/7-rpa-challenge-scrape-cmd-line/2556`. To run it you can download rcc (`https://github.com/robocorp/rcc`), go to the bot directory and execute de command `rcc run`.

## Requirements

To run the Keyword called `Command Opening Console` you **must uncomment it and change the terminal name to the one in your OS**, I was using Lubuntu, therefore, I search for `qterminal`. Because `Command Opening Console` is commented, in general the bot should run perfectly with the keyword `Command without Opening Console`. **To use `Command Opening Console` you must be in Linux, or change the command when it writes to the one used in another OS**
