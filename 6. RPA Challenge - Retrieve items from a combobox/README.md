# 6. RPA Challenge - Retrieve items from a combobox

This robot solves the RPA Challenge page (`http://rpachallenge.com/`) as described in `https://forum.uipath.com/t/6-rpa-challenge-retrieve-items-from-a-combobox/2411`. Thouhg, due to the page suggested to use is a not so "stable" I use the web page `https://ccxuf.csb.app/` in order to do what was asked. To run it you can download rcc (`https://github.com/robocorp/rcc`), go to the bot directory and execute de command `rcc run`.
